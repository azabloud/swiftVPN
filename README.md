# SwiftVPN
iOS VPN App - CMSI 3550 Final Project

swiftVPN is a simple iOS VPN App with access to five different VPN servers in New Jersey, London, Singapore, Amsterdam, and Bangalore.

The five VPN servers were set up using DigitialOcean droplets to create cloud servers at different data centers around the world. Each remote server had a Ubuntu operating system, and was accessible via a terminal which is where I was able to configure the IPsec VPN servers. 

Once I configured the VPN servers and they were running, I was then able to use the respective VPN credentials to access each server via the app I built in SwiftUI.
